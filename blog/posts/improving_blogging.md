As I'm writing posts in this blog I have some ideas 
for improving the workflow. For one, I am currently unable 
to quickly link to other posts within the blog. This should be 
easy to resolve. In my private notes I use vim-zettel, which allows 
me to use a shortcut to search through other notes in my directory and
link to them. 

Another feature that would be very useful is to be able to search for web links
right from the editor. For example if I am referencing an episode of the
Huberman Lab podcast, it would be extremely nice to have a shortcut like for
the local notes, which pulls data from a search engine. If I could get that
experience to be similar to using fzf inside the editor, this would be super
exciting.
