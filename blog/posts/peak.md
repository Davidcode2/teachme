Today I'll start reading the Book 'Peak - secrets from the new science of
expertise'. I want to document the process as to make sure to thoroughly read
and think throug the concepts. The goal is to incorporate at least one learning
into my daily life.

To start it might be helpful to gather what I think to already know about the
topic of "expertise". Or rather to define what I understand under the word and
what my expectations to the book are.

After the definition, I will start looking at the book and parsing the table of
contents. The idea here is to apply the learnings from the book "How to read a
book". The first stage here is "inspectional reading". Where I do not read line
by line but rather try to quickly get a high level overview of the contents. To
get a mental "map" of the book.

## Definition

Expertise is an attribute which is used to describe the quality in a person
which says about them that they posess of skills and knowledge which others do
not. One is an Expert in her field when one can set oneself apart from others
by means of the quality of ones skills.

Expertise is usually reached only through long and deliberate practice.
A term that is used by Robert Greene for perhaps the same thing is Mastery.

There are multiple dimensions to expertise. One is knowledge as in the ability
to recall facts and processes which aid in solving a specific problem. Another
is skill as in the ability to perform certain processes in an expert fashion.
Another yet is intuition as in the ability to quickly without concsious effort
categorize and find solutions to novel problems based on extensive past
experiences

I am trying to tie these dimensions to the terms procedural and conceptual 
but not sure this works out.

## Expectation

After reading the endorsements on the flap, I have some expectations of the
book. The general theme seems to be on performance. This might indicate things
like focus, learning and efficiency. One endorsement mentioned the importance
of being able to practically accomplish something. 

This might point to the learning technique as read about in Ultralearning:
performing drills. This is a technique where one focuses on a very specific
part of a skill and hones this part to a great degree. One example in the
context of writing might be to improve ones typing speed by practicing with
dedicated tools. Another might be to practice formulating sentences at great
speed by setting a time limit and writing as fast as one is physically able and
try to produce harmonious sentences. Lots of other examples could be found.

Another aspect that I expect to see is talk of recovery and spacing. As in
correct sleeping habits and healthy lifestyle. Focus is likely also going to
play a role. As is deliberate and deep work.

## Our potential is limitless

The greatest people of any profession have one thing in common: They put in
more hours than their peers. 

We now know that we aren't limited to just fulfilling our potential. Our
potential is possibly limitless. Perfect pitch can be taught. And it turns out
it can probably be taught to anyone.

But take Benjamin Franklin as an example. While he
was a great inventor and diplomat, he was only a mediocre chess player. Even
though he played a lot and for many years. So why didn't he become great? Because
by simply doing what one can already do one won't improve.

So it takes more than putting in the time. It takes deliberate practice.

## Adaptability

Given the right stimuli over an extended period of time our brains physiology
changes. Londons cab drivers need to learn amazing amounts of landmarks and
routes. The training is sometimes referred to as The Knowledge. It has been
shown that the Hippocampi - the area in the brain responsible for orientation -
are significantly enlarged in people who have successfully mastered The
Knowledge. The same is true for many other areas of expertise and brain
regions. Einstein had an enlarged region in the brain which is responsible for
Visualization. This can be seen in many mathematicians.

## Purposeful practice

Purposeful practice can be seen as a generalization of deliberate practice.
The following properties describe purposeful practice:  

- clearly specified goal
- focus on the task at hand
- tight feedback loop
- outside of comfort zone 

## Mental Representations

In order to learn something, one must have a clear mental representation of the
thing to achieve. For example a diver must have a clear mental representation
of the move he is going to perform. He needs to know where his body parts are
at any given time and how that feels. He needs to have an understanding of
where he is in space. Without this model the dive will be hard to accomplish.

This model does not pop out of the blue. People must inch forward toward a
clearer representation. The practice builds up the represenation and the
representation improves the practice.

To put this into the context of my own learning: When trying to understand how
a deployment works I will do two things. I will create the code, learning from
the internet, and will inch my understanding forward by changing the code,
going through trial and error. At some points I stop and check my mental
representation of how a deployment should work. Maybe I learned something
through my experimentation or a source at work or online which I will use to
update my representation. This updated representation can then improve my code
and so on. A virtuous circle.
