Today I'll start reading the Book 'Peak - secrets from the new science of
expertise'. I want to document the process as to make sure to thoroughly read
and think throug the concepts. The goal is to incorporate at least one learning
into my daily life.

To start it might be helpful to gather what I think to already know about the topic 
of "expertise". Or rather to define what I understand under the word and what my expectations
to the book are.

After the definition, I will start looking at the book and parsing the table of contents.
The idea here is to apply the learnings from the book "How to read a book". The first
stage here is "inspectional reading". Where I do not read line by line but rather 
try to quickly get a high level overview of the contents. To get a mental "map" of the book.
