During my walk today I tried to recap my learnings from the book
"Ultralearning" by Scott H. Young.

I'll recollect the learnings for each chapter.

**Metalearning**

This is drawing a map which will be used to travel to the desired goal. It
needs to leverage how others have attained mastery in the field. Some
strategies here include conducting interviews with experts in the field or
looking at study curricula for the given subject. The whole idea here is to
benefit from the experience of others. This maps nicely to the aspect of
deliberate practice where one needs to have a clearly defined path to
expertise.

**Focus**

In order to improve, one needs to have the ability to work in a focused  way.
Scott is agnostic on whether Focus is an ability which can be trained like any
other. I am pretty sure it is, based on my reading of Peak. 
Focus is defined by the following attributes: 

- ability to start focusing
- ability to retain focus
- ability to return to focus after the mind has wandered
- the amount of focused work one can do in a given time period e.g. the
  exhaustion of concentration

This is based on what I learned in the book "Hyperfocus" and also by some 
episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast.

**Directness**

This is another topic that maps directly to a concept from Peak. It highlights
the importance of learning a skill over learning a concept. So the focus is on
knowing *how* to do something over learning the *what*, or facts - skill over
knowledge. Ericson in his book emphasizes that the knowledge comes with the
skill and not the other way around. Scott provides some strategies to learn by
directly practicing the desired skill. For language learning this could be
**Immersion** For many practical skills like programming, engineering etc.
**Project based learning** is a good approach. What else was there? I can't
recall now but probably during writing the other sections it will pop up.

**Drills**

Here things get practical. What exactly does one need to do to improve?  
Doing a project is straight forward but how exactly will building a website 
make me a greater developer than any other learner who does the same?

Drills focus on a specific subskill in my domain. So when I am building a
website there a tons of subskills to be mastered. It is easy to assume that
someone quickly putting together a website with genAI will be less accomplished
by the end of the project than someone who performed drills on each aspect
involved.

Let's draw out some skills which could be learned by using drills. On the
starting side theres HTML. One can get away with a very basic skill level on
this front. But one could also go very deep and consider all the kinds of tags
and build example pages with those over and over again. The idea is to get the
skill of building a HTML template to a sort of muscle memory level. I could
imagine asking genAI to write up a catalog of scenarios for a website and use
this list to train building templates for those scenarios. Then one could continue
to learn about HTMLs impact on SEO, accessibility and so. The idea is to break 
a skill down and master each subskill.

For me a relevant area of practice right now would be authentication. I would need 
to look at different aspects and find opportunities to hone in on those through
practical execution.

Here it's also useful to point out a comment of Ericson: In order for the
practice to be efficient it needs to push you outside of your comfort zone. So
it is not useful to do the same thing over and over again but to always push a
little further.

**Feedback**

To make sure one is moving in the right direction and to quickly correct course
one needs feedback. This can be in the form of a compiler warning or through the help
of a mentor.
What are some aspects of good feedback?

- **fast**: the feedback should ideally be instantaneous. This is a problem with graded assignments in a
school or university scenario. By the time the feedback arrives it is basically useless. When practicing questions
online, make sure find a service which gives you the correct answer immediately for you to review.
- **directed**: Feedback comes in several forms. 
    - basic: Tells you simply whether you've done good or bad but nothing more.
    - specific: Tells you what you did wrong.
    - directed: Tells you what you did wrong and how one can generally improve it.
    - mentoring: The above plus advice tailored specifically to you.

I can't remember the terms used by Scott, so I made these up. Ideally you want
to get most of your feedback in the latter form. Finding a mentor isn't always
easy so what can we do to get good feedback? I think genAI provides some
potential here. 

**Retrieval**

Here some strategies for retrieval are given:

- spaced repetition
    - flash cards (anki)
- active recall
    - test to learn
    - closed book learning
- mnemonics
    - method of loci
    - visualization
    - story telling / proceduralization

**Intuition**

**Experimentation**
