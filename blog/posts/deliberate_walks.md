## Progress tracking of deliberate walks

The following table will serve my tracking of deliberate walks.
These walks should happen at least twice a week.

| Duration | Sprints      | Wandered / Sprint | Avg duration of wandering |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1h       | 5            | 3                 | 20s                       |
| 50m      | 3            | 6                 | 30s                       |
| 1h       | 4            | 5                 | 20s                       |
| 1h       | 4            | 2                 | 20s                       |
| 1h       | didn't count | 1                 | 10s                       |

**Analyzing wanderings**

Wanderings tended to occur when I came across people. The wanderings also seemed to cluster
toward the end of a ten minute sprint.

**Strategies for improvement**

Once I had started visualizing the chapters of the book and placing them along
the route of my walk (method of loci) focusing became a lot easier. Having the
visual places to go to and jump between provided a focal point which it was
easy to come back to.

This leads to one concrete improvement: Before starting, outline a path through the material
which can be followed during the walk.

What also seemed to help was tying the visualizations to the location. One
strategy I used was to spread the images out over the entire available space of
a location. The feeling of being able to walk "inside" the visualization was
helpful and it also provided a better connection to the location.

Another strategy I found was to flip from the horizontal perspective into
vertical birds eye perspective. This enables one to see all the locations like
in a map and makes it easier to jump between places.
