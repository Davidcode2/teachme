This is a book I read about a year ago. Today I tried 
to parse the memory palace I built while reading it.
I had revisited the palace a couple of times especially while 
reading the book. I probably went through the palace one time after 
completing reading it. But since that I don't recall having gone through it again.
I don't recall explicitly going through it after 

So today during my walk I checked in to see how much I could remember.
Let's go through the loci one by one.

For the purpose of speed I'll put everything down as bullet points and 
ask Gemini or some other GenAI to flesh these out.

**The garden**

- Fundamental attribution error (FAE).
- Framing
- Being swayed by other people
- Helping the mind work by thinking about a problem before going to bed.
  The mind will then work on that problem during sleep, and hopefully
  you'll have a solution upon waking up.

- Whats at the clothes line?
- At the mail box?

**The cellar**

- Cost benefit analysis - everything can be measured in dollars
- Sunk cost fallacy
- Loss aversion 
- something with Experts? Maybe putting too much trust in authorities such as scientists?

**Kitchen**

- Law of large numbers
- Bell curve (Normalverteilung) normal distribution
- Standard deviation
- Sensitivity and specificity

**Living room**

- ignore HIPPO (highest paid person in the room)
- The different methods for arriving at scientific results ordered by their quality:
    - anecdotal evidence 
    - natural experiments
    - multiple regression analysis 
    - double blind controlled experiment (the gold standard)

**Bedroom**

- Western logic (deductive)
    - Premise A, Premise B, Conclusion
- Eastern reasoning (dialectical)
    - Thesis, antithesis, synthesis

This is somewhat sparse, but I think it is a world better than if I had not
built the memory palace while reading the book. I've not done the experiment,
but I'd guess If I try to recall the contents of a book I read at around the
same time without constructing the palace I'd recall close to nothing.

This is likely simply due to the fact that my mind has nothing to cling on to,
no "anchor" which will lead me to the memory - or allow me to reconstruct the
knowledge.

**Note**

After coming back from my walk and starting to write about this some other loci
which I hadn't found on my walk pop back up. I don't easily recall what these
contain, but it's interesting to see them coming back now once I am working
through this on the keyboard.
