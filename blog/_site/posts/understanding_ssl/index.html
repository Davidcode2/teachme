  <p>After learning about the SSL handshake in <a href="/posts/playing_around_with_architecture_diagrams/">Playing around with
UML</a> I now want to answer a
few more questions to fill in the picture.</p>
<p>When a request is made from a client to a server, the client specifies which protocol
it wants to use. In the case of http, the client might specify that it wants to establish
an encrypted connection by using https.</p>
<p>When a https request is sent out, a handshake is carried out between the client
and the server. In essence, the client tells the server it would like to use an
encrypted connection. The server then offers its certificate. The client uses
the public key contained within the certificate to encrypt a pre-master key and
sends it to the server. The server can decrypt it and now both parties can use
this key (with some modifications - turning the pre-master key into a master
key) to encrypt their messages. Since both the client (it created it) and the
server (it has the private key to decrypt it) have the master key, they can
read each others messages. And the messages are encrypted while in transit. So
thats the part of the actual communication at a high level.</p>
<p>Now what about the certificates that lay on the server? These are a mystery to me. There
are two of them. One of them may be called <code>fullchain</code> and the other <code>privkey</code>.
So thinking about this and recollecting what I have read, these should serve the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fullchain</code> holds information which enables the client to verify the chain of
trust (whatever that means)</li>
<li><code>privkey</code> will be the certificate which contains the private key. Then this
would mean that this certificate will never leave the browser. If that is
true, the <code>fullchain</code> certificate will also contain the public key. Since in
my configuration there is no other certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's check what we got so far. Gemnini and a quick verification web search
tell me that the above reasoning is correct. The <code>fullchain</code> certificate
contains the public key, some info about the certificate like who it was issued
to, by whom (Certificate Authority) and when it will expire. Beyond that it contains
the intermediate CA or CAs which enable the client to trace the chain of trust
back to the Root CA.</p>
<p>Now what are those Certificate Authorities? It starts with the Root CAs. These
are a few trusted authorities. There is a list of those installed in a browser.
So when the browser receives a certificate, it will check the intermediate
authorities and trace them back to a root authority. If the root authority is
trusted (i.e. is stored in the browsers list) all is fine.</p>
<p>Here's how this hierarchy might look like:</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/.11ty/image/?src=posts%2Funderstanding_ssl%2F250312-2131-chain_of_trust.png&width=1223&format=webp&via=transform 1223w"><img src="/.11ty/image/?src=posts%2Funderstanding_ssl%2F250312-2131-chain_of_trust.png&width=1223&format=jpeg&via=transform" alt="Chain of trust visualization" width="1223" height="240"></picture></p>
<p>But how can this be checked? There would need to be some way for the browser to
verify that the root authority is legit and that it trusts the intermediate
authorities.</p>
<p>To do this the browser must check the digital signature of each certificate in
the chain. When a CA issues a certificate it calculates the hash over the certificates
content. It then encrypts the hash using the CAs private key. This encrypted hash
is attached to the issued certificate.</p>
<p>The client will upon receiving a certificate calculate the hash of it. It will
then decrypt the signature using the CAs public key. If the decrypted signature
matches the calculated hash, the CAs certificate is trusted.</p>

<p>The following diagram is a first attempt at working with icon libs in PlantUML.
This is an attempt to better understand how the chain of trust is verified.
I'll need to come back to this as I haven't had the opportunity to fact check
it and deepen my understanding. I'd also like to add a sequence diagram which
digs into more detail on how the certificates / signatures of each CA get
checked.</p>
