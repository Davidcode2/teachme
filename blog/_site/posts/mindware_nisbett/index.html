  <p>This is a book I read about a year ago. Today I tried
to parse the memory palace I built while reading it.
I had revisited the palace a couple of times especially while
reading the book. I probably went through the palace one time after
completing reading it. But since that I don't recall having gone through it again.
I don't recall explicitly going through it after</p>
<p>So today during my walk I checked in to see how much I could remember.
Let's go through the loci one by one.</p>
<p>For the purpose of speed I'll put everything down as bullet points and
ask Gemini or some other GenAI to flesh these out.</p>
<p><strong>The garden</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fundamental attribution error (FAE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Framing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being swayed by other people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping the mind work by thinking about a problem before going to bed.
The mind will then work on that problem during sleep, and hopefully
you'll have a solution upon waking up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whats at the clothes line?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the mail box?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The cellar</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost benefit analysis - everything can be measured in dollars</li>
<li>Sunk cost fallacy</li>
<li>Loss aversion</li>
<li>something with Experts? Maybe putting too much trust in authorities such as scientists?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kitchen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Law of large numbers</li>
<li>Bell curve (Normalverteilung) normal distribution</li>
<li>Standard deviation</li>
<li>Sensitivity and specificity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Living room</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ignore HIPPO (highest paid person in the room)</li>
<li>The different methods for arriving at scientific results ordered by their quality:
<ul>
<li>anectodal evidence</li>
<li>natural experiments</li>
<li>multiple regression analysis</li>
<li>double blind controlled experiment (the gold standard)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bedroom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Western logic (deductive)
<ul>
<li>Premise A, Premise B, Conclusion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eastern reasoning (dialectical)
<ul>
<li>Thesis, antithesis, synthesis</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is somewhat sparse, but I think it is a world better than if I had not
built the memory palace while reading the book. I've not done the experiment,
but I'd guess If I try to recall the contents of a book I read at around the
same time without constructing the palace I'd recall close to nothing.</p>
<p>This is likely simply due to the fact that my mind has nothing to cling on to,
no &quot;anchor&quot; which will lead me to the memory - or allow me to reconstruct the
knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>After coming back from my walk and starting to write about this some other loci
which I hadn't found on my walk pop back up. I don't easily recall what these
contain, but it's interesting to see them coming back now once I am working
through this on the keyboard.</p>
