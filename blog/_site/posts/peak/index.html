  <p>Today I'll start reading the Book 'Peak - secrets from the new science of
expertise'. I want to document the process as to make sure to thoroughly read
and think throug the concepts. The goal is to incorporate at least one learning
into my daily life.</p>
<p>To start it might be helpful to gather what I think to already know about the topic
of &quot;expertise&quot;. Or rather to define what I understand under the word and what my expectations
to the book are.</p>
<p>After the definition, I will start looking at the book and parsing the table of contents.
The idea here is to apply the learnings from the book &quot;How to read a book&quot;. The first
stage here is &quot;inspectional reading&quot;. Where I do not read line by line but rather
try to quickly get a high level overview of the contents. To get a mental &quot;map&quot; of the book.</p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Expertise is an attribute which is used to describe the quality in a person
which says about them that they posess of skills and knowledge which others do
not. One is an Expert in her field when one can set oneself apart from others
by means of the quality of ones skills.</p>
<p>Expertise is usually reached only through long and deliberate practice.
A term that is used by Robert Greene for perhaps the same thing is Mastery.</p>
<p>There are multiple dimensions to expertise. One is knowledge as in the ability
to recall facts and processes which aid in solving a specific problem. Another
is skill as in the ability to perform certain processes in an expert fashion.
Another yet is intuition as in the ability to quickly without concsious effort
categorize and find solutions to novel problems based on extensive past
experiences</p>
<p>I am trying to tie these dimensions to the terms procedural and conceptual
but not sure this works out.</p>
<h2>Expectation</h2>
<p>After reading the endorsements on the flap, I have some expectations of the
book. The general theme seems to be on performance. This might indicate things
like focus, learning and efficiency. One endorsement mentioned the importance
of being able to practically accomplish something.</p>
<p>This might point to the learning technique as read about in Ultralearning:
performing drills. This is a technique where one focuses on a very specific
part of a skill and hones this part to a great degree. One example in the
context of writing might be to improve ones typing speed by practicing with
dedicated tools. Another might be to practice formulating sentences at great
speed by setting a time limit and writing as fast as one is physically able and
try to produce harmonious sentences. Lots of other examples could be found.</p>
<p>Another aspect that I expect to see is talk of recovery and spacing. As in
correct sleeping habits and healthy lifestyle. Focus is likely also going to
play a role. As is deliberate and deep work.</p>
