  <p>Today I'll start reading the Book 'Peak - secrets from the new science of
expertise'. I want to document the process as to make sure to thoroughly read
and think throug the concepts. The goal is to incorporate at least one learning
into my daily life.</p>
<p>To start it might be helpful to gather what I think to already know about the topic
of &quot;expertise&quot;. Or rather to define what I understand under the word and what my expectations
to the book are.</p>
<p>After the definition, I will start looking at the book and parsing the table of contents.
The idea here is to apply the learnings from the book &quot;How to read a book&quot;. The first
stage here is &quot;inspectional reading&quot;. Where I do not read line by line but rather
try to quickly get a high level overview of the contents. To get a mental &quot;map&quot; of the book.</p>
