  <h2>Progress tracking of deliberate walks</h2>
<p>The following table will serve my tracking of deliberate walks.
These walks should happen at least twice a week.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Duration</th>
<th>Sprints</th>
<th>Wandered / Sprint</th>
<th>Avg duration of wandering</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1h</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>20s</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p><strong>Analyzing wanderings</strong></p>
<p>Wanderings tended to occur when I came across people. The wanderings also seemed to cluster
toward the end of a ten minute sprint.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for improvement</strong></p>
<p>Once I had started visualizing the chapters of the book and placing them along
the route of my walk (method of loci) focusing became a lot easier. Having the
visual places to go to and jump between provided a focal point which it was
easy to come back to.</p>
<p>This leads to one concrete improvement: Before starting, outline a path through the material
which can be followed during the walk.</p>
<p>What also seemed to help was tying the visualizations to the location. One
strategy I used was to spread the images out over the entire available space of
a location. The feeling of being able to walk &quot;inside&quot; the visualization was
helpful and it also provided a better connection to the location.</p>
<p>Another strategy I found was to flip from the horizontal perspective into
vertical birds eye perspective. This enables one to see all the locations like
in a map and makes it easier to jump between places.</p>
